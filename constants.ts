      title: 'Running the code on a micro-conflict.',
      log: 'Today, a minor disagreement arose with a collaborator over project direction. My initial reaction was defensive. Instead of reacting, I paused and ran the principle. I focused on finding my own internal calm before re-engaging. From that centered space, I was able to listen to their perspective without attachment to my own. The "conflict" dissolved, revealing a shared goal we hadn\'t seen. It wasn\'t about compromise; it was a synthesis. The system (our collaboration) shifted because one node (me) changed its state first. Bug report: The initial impulse to defend is strong. The latency between stimulus and peaceful response needs to be reduced through practice.',

      title: 'Decompiling the "not enough time" protocol.',
      log: 'Felt overwhelmed by my to-do list—a classic scarcity protocol. The resistance felt like a wall. I applied the principle by intentionally stopping all "productive" work. I spent 20 minutes observing the patterns of light on the floor, allowing my energy to flow without the resistance of obligation. When I returned to my list, the tasks hadn\'t changed, but my relationship to them had. The wall was gone. I completed the most important items with ease and clarity. The "time" didn\'t change, but the energy available within it expanded dramatically. The system wasn\'t the clock; it was my perception.',
